  <p>A parking-space sharing service.</p>
  <p>This year, the parking lot rules at Maine South changed so that specific spots are reserved for the entire year. But, nobody users his/her spot every day--there are days when a substantial portion of the parking lot sits empty. This is an inefficient system, and an unfair system for those who were not able to get a parking pass.</p>
  <p>Our idea is for a park-share program, in which the owners of parking spaces can “rent” them out for the day if they don’t plan to use it. </p>

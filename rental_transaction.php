//$resp is a numerical code for different scenarios... Here is the key
// -15 (default) means something royally screwed up... (didn't even access check_owner_verified.php)
// -7 means that the $owner variable does not own any parking spots (does not exist in owners table)
// -6 means that the designated $owner does exist in the owners table, but has his/her ownership is not verified
// -5 means that the designated $owner owns a spot and that spot is verified, but it is not the spot that $renter is requesting
// -4 occurs when the renter does not have enough balance to rent a spot
// -3 is a failure in executing the SQL Query to deduct $1.50 from the renters account
// -2 is a failure in executing the SQL Query to retreive the owner's balance
// -1 is a failure in executing the SQL Query to add $1.50 to the owners account
// 1 is a success!
